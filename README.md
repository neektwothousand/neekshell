# neekshell-telegrambot
I'm a newbie to shell scripting and I made this bot for fun, feel free to criticize

This bot needs a web server to set a webhook pointing on neekshell-webhook.php, to execute the script on request

Utilities used:
  - GNU Wget, sed, and various coreutils
  - jq (https://stedolan.github.io/jq/)
